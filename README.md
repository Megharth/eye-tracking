# eye-tracking

The idea is to create a generalized tool that can be seamlessly combined with other system like electric wheelchair, movable patient bed, eye-controlled alerting mechanism for disabled people etc. The main objective here is to capture live image and also establish the system that can recognize pupil movement in live image. 

Software Requirements
* Operating System: Linux
* Back End: Python, OpenCV Library

Hardware Requirements

Qudraplegic patients depends on other to help them to move on wheelchair. So, the main aim of our project to automate the wheelchair. This will reduce the burden on the patient to manually handle the wheelchair. In most of the cases of paralysis the patient can operate their eyes. So, our project aims to control the wheelchair using the pupils of the patient using computer vision. Thus, we can summarize that
our main objective to develop a “vision-based wheelchair system”.
