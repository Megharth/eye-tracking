Qudraplegic patients depends on other to help them to move on wheelchair. So, the main aim of our project to automate the wheelchair. This will reduce the burden on the patient to manually handle the wheelchair. In most of the cases of paralysis the patient can operate their eyes. So, our project aims to control the wheelchair using the pupils of the patient using computer vision. Thus, we can summarize that
our main objective to develop a “vision-based wheelchair system”.
